# Vin Dreusmire | Field Notes

This repository contains the source code for [my site lol](vincentdreusmire.site)—a personal site built as a quiet archive.

The site is not a product or performance. It exists to house field notes, observations, and work logs. The emphasis is on clarity, process, and documentation rather than branding or self-promotion.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Landing page.
- `ops-log.html` — A running log of research, field observations, or fragments of note.
- `about.html` — A brief statement of intent and identity.
- `style.css` — Core stylesheet; minimal and tactile in design.
- `README.md` — You’re reading it.

## License

No license. Not open source. This is a personal project. Fork only with permission.
