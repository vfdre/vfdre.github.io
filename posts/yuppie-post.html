    Heresy, the Default of a NY Yuppie
  </a>
</h2>

<p>Dear readers,</p>

<p>This week, I met a New Yorker from Manhattan. Our interactions started off fine enough, you know — she was just a little bit quirky and a lotta bit loud. Nothing too difficult to handle. Then bit by bit her yankee-isms slipped out rotting like a roadkill heron. It started off small. She was fascinated by the concept of non-pigeon birds and insisted I be her own personal birder. Lady, I can’t tell a jackdaw from a magpie — the bird we saw looked maybe like a seed-eating bird… of some kind? It had the beak for it. And she drove me up the wall telling strangers she “nearly got attacked by a gator but it turned out to be a gecko.” Mind you, this isn’t Miami, and the gator-gecko was actually a female red-throated anole on the sidewalk outside minding her own business. Like how I should’ve been minding my own instead of entertaining this for so long.</p>

<p>I didn’t know someone could complain about the heat so many times while wearing pretty much the exact same all black long-sleeve outfit as me. Or waddle so slowly. Or not automatically wander to the shade during peak temperature like any reasonable (read: Southern) folk would do. Drink water, hug a tree (hug a saw palmetto if you’re a tourist), and keep it moving before the fruit salad spoils in the sun.</p>

<p>Aren’t New Yorkers supposed to be the fast ones always zipping around Neuw Yawkkkkk with a baconeggncheese barking at their fellow pedestrians? Maybe Manhattan magically doesn’t get as hot in the summer like regular New York.</p>

<p>Then again, from her anecdotes, trees don’t exist there in any capacity. Just civilized rats, cheap pizza, and skyscrapers. Concrete jungle wet dream tomato, indeed.</p>

<p>It was interesting the first couple of days—I can stomach a tourist, and maybe even a Yankee in small, manageable doses. But I can’t abide a yuppie. Humidity is a blessing from the Lord. Sweet tea is a birthright, not a novelty. And being a Yankee is already a cardinal sin. We don’t need to go kissing the devil on top of it.</p>

<p>God bless the South for repelling these characters — more tea and pie for us!</p>
